# AGENTS.md

Guidance for human and AI contributors working in this repository.

## 1. Purpose

Paperclip is a control plane for AI-agent companies.
The current implementation target is V1 and is defined in `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`.

## 2. Read This First

Before making changes, read in this order:

1. `doc/GOAL.md`
2. `doc/PRODUCT.md`
3. `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`
4. `doc/DEVELOPING.md`
5. `doc/DATABASE.md`

`doc/SPEC.md` is long-horizon product context.
`doc/SPEC-implementation.md` is the concrete V1 build contract.

## 3. Repo Map

- `server/`: Express REST API and orchestration services
- `ui/`: React + Vite board UI
- `packages/db/`: Drizzle schema, migrations, DB clients
- `packages/shared/`: shared types, constants, validators, API path constants
- `doc/`: operational and product docs

## 4. Dev Setup (Auto DB)

Use embedded PostgreSQL in dev by leaving `DATABASE_URL` unset.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- API: `http://localhost:3100`
- UI: `http://localhost:3100` (served by API server in dev middleware mode)

Quick checks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health
curl http://localhost:3100/api/companies
```

Reset local dev DB:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.paperclip/instances/default/db
pnpm dev
```

## 5. Git Branch Workflow

Paperclip's canonical upstream default branch is `master`, not `main`.

- When this repository is checked out as a fork with an `upstream` remote, treat `upstream/master` as the source of truth.
- Keep local `master` clean and disposable. Do not commit directly to `master`.
- If the fork carries long-lived local/custom Paperclip changes, keep them on a dedicated integration branch such as `current-work`.
- Do real work on short-lived branches or worktrees cut from that integration branch.
- Before starting work, prefer updating `master` from upstream, rebasing the integration branch, then branching or creating a worktree from that clean customized base.
- If `master` is only a mirror branch, the safe sync flow is:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git switch master
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push --force-with-lease origin master
```

- Then refresh the long-lived integration branch:

```sh
git switch current-work
git rebase upstream/master
git push --force-with-lease origin current-work
```

- Rebase short-lived work branches onto `upstream/master` or the refreshed integration branch, depending on whether they are upstream-first or fork-only work.
- Use `--force-with-lease` when updating rebased feature branches on your fork.
- Never use `main` as the Paperclip upstream branch name in repo instructions, examples, or automation.
- Do not hard-reset `master` if it contains unique local commits or is being used as a shared collaboration branch.
- If the integration branch becomes difficult to rebase, split it into smaller stacked branches or upstreamable PR-sized chunks.

## 6. Core Engineering Rules

1. Keep changes company-scoped.
Every domain entity should be scoped to a company and company boundaries must be enforced in routes/services.

2. Keep contracts synchronized.
If you change schema/API behavior, update all impacted layers:
- `packages/db` schema and exports
- `packages/shared` types/constants/validators
- `server` routes/services
- `ui` API clients and pages

3. Preserve control-plane invariants.
- Single-assignee task model
- Atomic issue checkout semantics
- Approval gates for governed actions
- Budget hard-stop auto-pause behavior
- Activity logging for mutating actions

4. Do not replace strategic docs wholesale unless asked.
Prefer additive updates. Keep `doc/SPEC.md` and `doc/SPEC-implementation.md` aligned.

5. Keep plan docs dated and centralized.
New plan documents belong in `doc/plans/` and should use `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` filenames.

## 7. Database Change Workflow

When changing data model:

1. Edit `packages/db/src/schema/*.ts`
2. Ensure new tables are exported from `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts`
3. Generate migration:

```sh
pnpm db:generate
```

4. Validate compile:

```sh
pnpm -r typecheck
```

Notes:
- `packages/db/drizzle.config.ts` reads compiled schema from `dist/schema/*.js`
- `pnpm db:generate` compiles `packages/db` first

## 8. Verification Before Hand-off

Run this full check before claiming done:

```sh
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
pnpm build
```

If anything cannot be run, explicitly report what was not run and why.

## 9. API and Auth Expectations

- Base path: `/api`
- Board access is treated as full-control operator context
- Agent access uses bearer API keys (`agent_api_keys`), hashed at rest
- Agent keys must not access other companies

When adding endpoints:

- apply company access checks
- enforce actor permissions (board vs agent)
- write activity log entries for mutations
- return consistent HTTP errors (`400/401/403/404/409/422/500`)

## 10. UI Expectations

- Keep routes and nav aligned with available API surface
- Use company selection context for company-scoped pages
- Surface failures clearly; do not silently ignore API errors

## 11. Definition of Done

A change is done when all are true:

1. Behavior matches `doc/SPEC-implementation.md`
2. Typecheck, tests, and build pass
3. Contracts are synced across db/shared/server/ui
4. Docs updated when behavior or commands change
